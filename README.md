# Funnel-Analysis-of-Online-Taxi-App

## Summary  
This project presents the findings of a funnel analysis conducted on Metrocar's customer journey. The analysis aims to identify areas for improvement and optimization in the customer funnel. Key results include conversion rates at each stage of the funnel, insights on platform performance, age group performance, surge pricing opportunities, and user experience analysis. Based on these results, recommendations are provided to address the identified areas for improvement.

## Context
Metrocar is a ride-sharing app that connects riders with drivers through a mobile application. The customer funnel consists of several stages, including app download, signup, ride request, driver acceptance, ride completion, payment, and review. The analysis is based on a dataset containing information on app downloads, user signups, ride requests, transactions, and driver reviews.

## Business Questions
The analysis addresses the following business questions:

1. What steps of the funnel should we research and improve? Are there any specific drop-off points preventing users from completing their first ride?
2. Metrocar currently supports 3 different platforms: iOS, Android, and web. To recommend where to focus our marketing budget for the upcoming year, what insights can we make based on the platform?
3. What age groups perform best at each stage of our funnel? Which age group(s) likely contain our target customers?
4. Surge pricing is the practice of increasing the price of goods or services when there is the greatest demand for them. If we want to adopt a price-surging strategy, what does the distribution of ride requests look like throughout the day?
5. What part of our funnel has the lowest conversion rate? What can we do to improve this part of the funnel?

## Results
The analysis revealed the following key findings:

- Funnel Conversion Rate Analysis: The conversion rates at each stage of the funnel were analyzed, highlighting areas of improvement and drop-off points.
- Funnel Drop-offs Analysis by Platform and User Group: The analysis examined drop-off rates across platforms and age groups, identifying common pain points and areas for improvement.
- Surge Pricing: The distribution of ride requests throughout the day indicated high demand during specific time periods, suggesting opportunities for surge pricing.
- Transactions by User Demographics and Platform Type: The performance of Metrocar's platforms and their contribution to revenue were analyzed to guide marketing budget allocation.
- User Experience Analysis: User reviews and ratings were analyzed to identify common issues and areas for improvement in service quality and customer satisfaction.

## Recommendations

1. Improve ride completion rate by addressing issues during the ride that lead to user cancellations or abandonment.
2. Enhance review participation by encouraging users to provide feedback and rate their ride experience through in-app prompts or incentives.
